Database Management Steps for Login and Signup:

1. Created a MySQL Database:
   - Created a MySQL database named 'myca4' using the following SQL commands:
     ```
     CREATE DATABASE myca4;
     USE myca4;
     ```

2. Defined Tables:
   - Created a 'users' table with columns:
     - user_id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
     - username (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)
     - password (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)

3. Python Flask Application:
   - Developed a Flask web application for user authentication.

4. Created a Database Connection:
   - Established a connection to the MySQL database in Python using the 'mysql.connector' library.
   - Configured the connection with host, user, password, and database name.

5. Signup Functionality:
   - Implemented a signup route ('/signup') where users can register by providing a username and password.
   - Validated username uniqueness in the database.
   - Stored user data (username and hashed password) in the 'users' table.

6. Login Functionality:
   - Created a login route ('/login') for users to log in using their username and password.
   - Retrieved user data from the 'users' table based on the provided username.
   - Checked the hashed password against the stored password hash for authentication.

These steps outline the database-related actions for implementing a simplified login and signup functionality in a Flask application.
